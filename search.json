At the end of the 6 blocks, a 2 month capstones project is required to complete the program, resulting in a total program length of 10 months.\nWith the large number of deadlines and the variability in workload across the 5 weeks within each block, it is difficult for students to get a sense of where they are in the program at a given time. This helper package provides date-based tools to describe a student’s academic position, program phase, and progress, and support planning for personal commitments, absences, late submissions, and meeting course-level requirements.\nThis helper is based on a program cofiguration for the 2025/2026 cohort, and would need to be adapted for other program cycles.\nThere is no package that is specific to the MDS program. However, we will be using the python standard library of datetime and calendar to streamline date calculations and interpretations.\n\n\n“I have a family committment to go to on December 2-4th, 2025.
