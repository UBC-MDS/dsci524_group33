    "text": "ubc_mds_helper is a project that helps students in the UBC Masters of Data Science (MDS) program better understand and plan their academic timeline.\nWith the large number of deadlines and the variability in workload across the 5 weeks within each block, it is difficult for students to get a sense of where they are in the program at a given time. This helper package provides date-based tools to describe a student’s academic position, program phase, and progress, and support planning for personal commitments, absences, late submissions, and meeting course-level requirements.\n\n\nWe set up our date configuration to the 2025/2026 cycle, as shown in config.py.\nIf other years are needed, the config.py file would need to be updated.\n\nfrom ubc_mds_helper.status import status\nfrom ubc_mds_helper.config import PROGRAM_CONFIG_2025_2026\n\nstatus(PROGRAM_CONFIG_2025_2026, \"January 15, 2026\")\n\n{'date': datetime.date(2026, 1, 15),\n 'day_of_week': 'Thursday',\n 'block': 4,\n 'week_in_block': 2,\n 'during_break': False,\n 'break_name': None,\n 'days_until_next_break': 31,\n 'next_break_name': 'Winter break',\n 'between_blocks': False}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe late_assignment() function applies the UBC MDS late-submission policy.\nIt prints the late penalty applied to an assignment based on the number of days it is late, and returns the adjusted grade.\nInputs - raw_grade (float or int): original grade (0–100) - late_count (int): number of previous late submissions - is_lower_stakes (bool): if True, late submissions are not accepted for lower-stakes assignments (e.g., quizzes, labs)\nOutputs - float: grade after the late-submission scaling is applied\n\nfrom ubc_mds_helper.assessments import late_assignment\n\n# Example 1: on-time submission\nprint(\"\\nExample 1: on-time submission\")\nadjusted_grade = late_assignment(\n    raw_grade=85,\n    late_count=0,\n    is_lower_stakes=False\n)\nprint(\"Adjusted grade:\", adjusted_grade)  # Expected: 85\n\n# Example 2: late submission with no prior late submissions\nprint(\"\\nExample 2: late submission with no prior late submissions\")\nadjusted_grade = late_assignment(\n    raw_grade=90,\n    late_count=0,\n    is_lower_stakes=False\n)\nprint(\"Adjusted grade:\", adjusted_grade)  # Expected: 80.0\n\n\nExample 1: on-time submission\nStatus: Late (1st occurrence)\nLate count: 1\nScaling factor: 0.75\nAdjusted grade: 63.75\n\nExample 2: late submission with no prior late submissions\nStatus: Late (1st occurrence)\nLate count: 1\nScaling factor: 0.75\nAdjusted grade: 67.5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe needed_to_pass() function helps you answer a very practical question:\n“Given the grades I already have, what minimum grade do I need on each remaining component to finish the course with at least 60%?”\nIt assumes you will earn the same grade on every remaining component, and returns that required grade for each remaining item.\nWhat grading schemes are supported?\nneeded_to_pass() supports two course grading layouts, selected by course_type: 1. course_type=“quiz”\nlab1, lab2, lab3, lab4 are 12.5% each quiz1, quiz2 are 25% each\n\ncourse_type=“project”\n\nMilestone1 - Milestone4 are 20% each IndividualAssignment1 - IndividualAssignment4 are 5% each\nInputs 1. course_type: string Must be exactly: “quiz” or “project”\ngrades: dictionary A dictionary of completed components → grade earned (0–100). Example: {“lab1”: 80, “quiz1”: 70}\nDictionary rules: - keys must be strings (component names) - values must be numbers (int/float) - grades must be between 0 and 100\nOutput The function returns a dict of remaining components mapped to the minimum grade needed on each (same value for all remaining components).\nExample output: {“lab3”: 52.5, “lab4”: 52.5, “quiz2”: 52.5}\nUsage examples:\n\nQuiz based course\n\nInput:\n\nfrom ubc_mds_helper.grade import needed_to_pass\n\nneeded_to_pass(\"quiz\", {\"lab1\": 80, \"lab2\": 70, \"quiz1\": 60})\n\n{'lab3': 52.5, 'lab4': 52.5, 'quiz2': 52.5}\n\n\n\nProject based course\n\n\nfrom ubc_mds_helper.grade import needed_to_pass\n\nneeded_to_pass(\"project\", {\"Milestone1\": 80})\n\n{'IndividualAssignment1': 55.0,\n 'IndividualAssignment2': 55.0,\n 'Milestone2': 55.0,\n 'IndividualAssignment3': 55.0,\n 'Milestone3': 55.0,\n 'IndividualAssignment4': 55.0,\n 'Milestone4': 55.0}\n\n\nHave fun using it!\n\n\n\nThe visualize_program_progress() function calculates how far along you are in the MDS program and saves a bar chart containing your progress to the img/ folder.

At the end of the 6 blocks, a 2 month capstones project is required to complete the program, resulting in a total program length of 10 months.\nWith the large number of deadlines and the variability in workload across the 5 weeks within each block, it is difficult for students to get a sense of where they are in the program at a given time. This helper package provides date-based tools to describe a student’s academic position, program phase, and progress, and support planning for personal commitments, absences, late submissions, and meeting course-level requirements.\nThis helper is based on a program configuration for the 2025/2026 cohort, and would need to be adapted for other program cycles.\nThere is no package that is specific to the MDS program. However, we will be using the python standard library of datetime and calendar to streamline date calculations and interpretations.\n\n\n“I have a family commitment to go to on December 2-4th, 2025. Am I able to make it work based on positioning in the 6 week cycle?”\n“When is the next break for me to plan my holiday?”\n“I failed the first quiz, and need to make sure I pass the course. What do I have to get on the second quiz?”\n“I already have 2 late assignments.

For higher-stakes assessments, the grade is scaled based on the cumulative number of late submissions. For lower-stakes assessments, late submissions are not accepted and receive a grade of zero.\nInputs\n\nraw_grade (float or int): The original grade before applying any late-submission penalty.\nlate_count (int): The number of late submissions prior to this one.\nis_lower_stakes (bool): Indicates whether the assessment is lower-stakes. If True, the late submission is not accepted and receives zero points. Default is False.\n\nOutputs\n\nfloat: the final grade after applying the late-submission scaling.\n\nExample\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from ubc_mds_helper.assessments import late_assignment\n&gt;&gt;&gt; late_assignment(80, 0)\n# Status: Late (1st occurrence)\n# Late count: 1\n# Scaling factor: 0.75\n# 60.0\n\n\n\nThis function helps students estimate the minimum grades needed on remaining course components to finish with at least 60%.\nInputs course_type (str) - Course grading scheme.

At the end of the 6 blocks, a 2 month capstones project is required to complete the program, resulting in a total program length of 10 months.\nWith the large number of deadlines and the variability in workload across the 5 weeks within each block, it is difficult for students to get a sense of where they are in the program at a given time. This helper package provides date-based tools to describe a student’s academic position, program phase, and progress, and support planning for personal commitments, absences, late submissions, and meeting course-level requirements.\nThis helper is based on a program configuration for the 2025/2026 cohort, and would need to be adapted for other program cycles.\nThere is no package that is specific to the MDS program. However, we will be using the python standard library of datetime and calendar to streamline date calculations and interpretations.\n\n\n“I have a family commitment to go to on December 2-4th, 2025. Am I able to make it work based on positioning in the 6 week cycle?”\n“When is the next break for me to plan my holiday?”\n“I failed the first quiz, and need to make sure I pass the course.
