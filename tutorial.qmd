## Tools to help navigate MDS

ubc_mds_helper is a project that helps students in the UBC Masters of Data Science (MDS) program better understand and plan their academic timeline.

With the large number of deadlines and the variability in workload across the 5 weeks within each block, it is difficult for students to get a sense of where they are in the program at a given time. This helper package provides date-based tools to describe a student's academic position, program phase, and progress, and support planning for personal commitments, absences, late submissions, and meeting course-level requirements. 

### Status

We set up our date configuration to the 2025/2026 cycle, as shown in config.py.

If other years are needed, the config.py file would need to be updated.

```{python}
from ubc_mds_helper.status import status
from ubc_mds_helper.config import PROGRAM_CONFIG_2025_2026

status(PROGRAM_CONFIG_2025_2026, "January 15, 2026")

```
